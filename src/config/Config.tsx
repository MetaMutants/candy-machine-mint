    text: 'MetaMartians once lived in harmony in Web2, but this harmony was short-lived. Everything changed when deciding to move to Web3 for a better future. The disagreement began on the superior blockchain to move to. The conflict split the Martians into two groups: 5,000  that supported Solana and 5,000 that supported Ethereum. After a terrible civil war, half the population was eradicated. The two groups agreed for their civilization to coexist on both blockchains. This evenly split the Martians 2,500 and 2,500 between Solana and Ethereum. By buying a MetaMartian on the Solana blockchain, you will be whitelisted to get a MetaMartian on the Ethereum blockchain in the future.'
